transfreq
=========

Welcome to the documentation of transfreq, a Python3 library for automatically 
computing the individual transition frequency from theta to alpha band. 
transreq only requires in input the power density of EEG data recorded during a 
resting state.  

A detailed description of the algorithm implemented in transfreq can be found
in the origial paper [1]_.

Installation
============

To install the latest stable version of this package use ``pip``:

.. code::

    pip install transfreq

If you do not have admin privileges on the computer, use the ``--user`` flag
with ``pip``. 

To check if everything worked fine, you can run:

.. code::

    python -c 'import sesameeg'

and it should not give any error messages.
